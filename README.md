# Reason React Electron Boilerplate
This project is designed to make it easy for me to start a new project that uses these technologies.
It also has Sass and a built in GPL Icomoon font to make the apps pretty.

Please note that this project is for my personal use. It should be easy enough to get started with and it is pretty modular
so it swapping sections out should be simple, but I will not add anything in unless I think it would be useful.
Feel free to make a pull request though or if it isn't for me then you can always fork it.
